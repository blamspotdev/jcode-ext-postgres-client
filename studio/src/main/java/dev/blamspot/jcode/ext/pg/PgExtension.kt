/**
 * The Postgres client, native.
 *
 * The entry point JCode instantiates by name and splices into its own composition. Everything here
 * runs in JCode's process against JCode's Compose runtime — hence the compileOnly dependency rules
 * in the build script.
 *
 * One extension, two surfaces: the drawer that lists servers and databases, and the studio a
 * database opens into. The studio owns its own state and asks the server its own questions, because
 * it opens on its own — restored with a session, or reached from another tab — and cannot see what
 * the drawer decided.
