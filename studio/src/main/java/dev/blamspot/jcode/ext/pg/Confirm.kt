/**
 * Something the extension wants a yes to before it does it.
 *
 * Shared by the drawer panel and the manage page rather than written twice: they ask the same kinds
 * of question — discard this, drop that, rename this to what — and an answer that looked different
 * depending on which surface asked would be two dialogs to trust instead of one.
 *
 * [input] turns the prompt into a small form: non-null shows a field seeded with that value, and
 * [onConfirm] receives what it holds. Without it the field is absent and [onConfirm] gets "".
 *
 * Whether that field is required follows [destructive], and both call sites depend on it: a rename
 * has nothing to do without a name, so its button waits for one; a stash message only improves a
 * name git would otherwise invent, so a blank one still goes through.
