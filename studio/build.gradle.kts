/**
 * The Postgres studio, drawn natively inside JCode's own process.
 *
 * What ships is `classes.dex`, not the APK the build produces around it: this plugin owns no
 * resources — every icon it draws is a vector built in code — so there is no resource table for
 * JCode's `addAssetPath` to attach.
 *
 * **The dependency rules are the ABI.** Anything JCode already ships is `compileOnly`: the plugin
 * must resolve those classes from JCode at runtime, because the composition it returns is spliced
 * into JCode's own and two Compose runtimes in one process do not interoperate. Nothing here is
 * bundled, which is why this dex is small — it is this plugin's code and nothing else.
