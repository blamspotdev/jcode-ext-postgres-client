// Production build for the Postgres Client extension.
//
// What ships is one file: `lib/pgstudio.dex`, the extension's own code, drawn by JCode's Compose
// runtime inside JCode's process. `jext pack` runs this (npm run build) before packaging.
//
// The dex is taken from the merge task's output rather than unzipped back out of the APK the Android
// plugin builds around it: the APK is a by-product here — this plugin owns no resources, so there is
// no resource table for JCode to attach and nothing else in the archive worth keeping.
//
// The module is `studio/`, not `native/`: that name is taken by libandroshm.c, the LD_PRELOAD shim
// that lets PostgreSQL start on a kernel built without SysV IPC.
